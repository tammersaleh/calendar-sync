### B2 - Bogus `migration_source_won` outcomes in dry-run

15 patches reported with `conflict: migration_source_won` despite zero v1/v2 mirrors on the target. Two cooperating causes per `doc/dry-run-anomaly-analysis.md`:

- Cause A: `dryRunAPI.EventsPatch` echoes only the request body, dropping any extended properties the prior insert wrote.
- Cause B: source-list duplication - `_R<timestamp>` recurring parents appear both as a top-level event and as a `recurring_event_id` on their instances, so `runClassifyLoop` processes the same source tuple twice.

Dry-run cosmetic only - production semantics are unaffected (real Calendar API merges patches correctly).

Fix sketch: dedupe `runClassifyLoop` by source-tuple and tighten `dryRunAPI.EventsPatch` to merge into a cached resource.

### B3 - gws subprocess timeouts cascade to `partial_failure`

A 365-day-horizon dry-run produced ~200 `gws subprocess: context deadline exceeded` errors. The outer `--timeout` default is 5m; per-event `events.instances` lookups serialize and queue past it.

Possible mitigations:
- Increase the per-event gws subprocess timeout independently of the outer wall-clock cap.
- Reduce per-event API calls (e.g. cache the target instances list rather than one call per instance).
- Parallelize per-event processing.

### B4 - No `--horizon` CLI flag

`config.toml` has `horizon`, but there's no `--horizon` flag override. User wants day-by-day rollout (`--horizon=1d`, `2d`, ..., `365d`) without editing config each time.

### B5 - gws stderr bleeds into the error message

A captured failure cause read:

```
horizon check for recurring parent 2on8pejh4aunu1nqco5hi7ut88: api_invalid_request during events.instances: Using keyring backend: keyring
error: HTTP request failed
```

`Using keyring backend: keyring` is gws's own informational stderr leaking into the formatted error string. Not safety-critical but obscures the real error.

## Fixed

### F1 - `partial_failure` envelope dropped underlying error

Initially fixed in `5a412e6 fix: surface underlying error in partial_failure stderr envelope` but that pass missed the joinError case. Followup `803317c fix: surface joinError cause in partial_failure stderr envelope` reads `cmdError.cause` directly via type assertion. Verified empirically against the live calendar - the envelope's `cause` field now carries the joined classify errors (~32KB).

### B1 - `--help` triggered a live run on subcommands (CRITICAL)

`./calendar-sync run --help` printed kong's usage text AND then executed a real, non-dry-run sync. 37 mirror events landed on `me@tammersaleh.com` before the process was killed.

Root cause: `cmd/cli.go` constructed the kong parser with `kong.Exit(func(int) {})` so kong's `helpFlag.BeforeReset` (which calls `ctx.Kong.Exit(0)` after printing help) became a no-op. Parse returned successfully and `kctx.Run(rt)` dispatched the subcommand. Same mechanism would have triggered for kong `VersionFlag` and any future kong-builtin terminator.

Fixed in `9705671 fix: short-circuit kong --help / --version before subcommand dispatch`. The kong-Exit callback now writes the code into a sentinel; if Parse called Exit, `Run()` returns that code without dispatching. `TestRun_HelpFlagDoesNotDispatchSubcommand` (`cmd/cli_test.go`) pins the invariant for every subcommand including --help mixed with other flags and --quiet. Subcommands with required positional args (`mirror prune`, `mirror list`, `pair test`, top-level) still hit kong's pre-hook positional validation, so they exit 64 with "expected <X>" - the subcommand's Run is still NOT dispatched, which is the load-bearing safety guarantee.

### B6 - `[settings].dry_run = true` did not suppress writes

SPEC line 253 promised `[settings].dry_run = true` would suppress writes. The field was parsed into `config.Settings.DryRun` and emitted in `config show` output but never threaded into `newDryRunAPI()`. A user with `dry_run = true` in config.toml got live writes anyway from `run` and `watch`.

Fixed in `aa01edf fix: wire [settings].dry_run to dryRunAPI wrapper in run / watch`. `RunCmd.run` now ORs `c.DryRun` with `canonical.Settings.DryRun`. `WatchCmd.Run` (no `--dry-run` flag) gates solely on the settings field. `pair test` inherits via the `RunCmd{DryRun: true}` it constructs. `mirror prune` is intentionally NOT gated by settings - it has its own `--dry-run` flag and SPEC scopes settings.dry_run to the sync loop. Verified by `TestRunCmd_SettingsDryRunGatesWrites` and `TestWatchCmd_SettingsDryRunGatesWrites`, both using `panicWriteGws` so any leaked write surfaces as a descriptive panic.
